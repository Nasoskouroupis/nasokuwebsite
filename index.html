                    For the first part, automatic image tagging technologies (such as EyeEm Vision, Google Cloud Vision or Clarifai) are quickly
                    becoming more powerful. They are helping tell the stories behind photographs by automatically indexing
                    or tagging them to make them discoverable. [1] For the second part, the field of visual aesthetics addresses
                    the way each story is told. Specifically, how the visual style and composition of an image create an
                    emotional connection with the viewer. In other words: try to understand what makes an image really outstanding
                    and impactful compared to others — and apply that criteria to any photo in the world. Imagine a scenario
                    in which an art professor wants to teach her class how to understand what makes a good photo. One methodology
                    that she can use is to show her students examples of how she might curate a set of photographs. She groups
                    the good photos together and sets the not so good photos apart. After doing this process multiple times,
                    she will ask her students to repeat it. The only feedback she gives, is if the student was successful
                    in his/her choice. If the student succeeds, he/she continues with the exercise. Otherwise, the student
                    has to think over the error, learn from it and move onto the next set of photos. This is the basic process
                    machine learning systems also go through.
